				<h3>Bandana Waddle Dee</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Gender: &#9794;</li>
						<li>Height: 150cm (4'11")</li>
						<li>Species: Waddle Dee</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						A spry servant at Castle Dedede who dreams of joining the royal guard. Technically a guard but acts as Dedede's butler most of the time.
						His parents have always worked in the castle, so he also grew up in it and became very accustomed to its politics.
						Always puts others before himself, which brings his self-esteem to question. Still the most sane person in Dreamland.
					</p>
					<p>
						Likes sleeping while standing, fresh juice, and training. Dislikes unknown.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inspired by Meta Knight's swordsmanship, he asks him to train him for combat. He's a rookie but is serious about improving, a drive that Meta
						wishes was more common in Dreamlanders.
					</p>
					<p>
						Meets Gooey through Kirby and becomes very close with him.
