				<h3>Warp Star</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Gender: &#9792;</li>
						<li>Height: 156cm (5'1")</li>
						<li>Species: Incarnation/spirit</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Self-proclaimed princess of Dreamland and King Dedede's sister. 
						A serious and proper lady that's trying to keep her head out of the past. Her DM-induced PTSD makes her paranoid about
						Dreamland's future with Kirby in it.
						While she's uninterested in combat, her speed, stamina, and royal attitude are unmatched. 
						Her physical body is the star, which she keeps as a hairpin under her left bang when using her humanoid form.
					</p>
				<h4>History</h4>
					<p>
						Warp Star once peacefully ruled over Dreamland with her brother.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because she cannot see Kirby as anyone but Nil, she's terrified of him and acts as if she doesn't exist 
						so he doesn't get any ideas. 
						Due to this, Kirby believes her to be an extension of himself and manhandles her like a toy. 
						She rejects his later and more earnest attempts to make amends, but secretly tries to understand him.
					</p>
