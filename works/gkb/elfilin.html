				<h3>Elfilin</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Gender: &#9792;</li>
						<li>Height: 135cm (4'5")</li>
						<li>Species: ???</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						A young lady Kirby and co. meet in the New World. Intelligent but withdrawn, she wants to prove herself useful and
						offers guidance and support when she can.
						Her unusual features, like her soft wing-shaped hair and tail, set her apart from any species around.
					</p>
					<p>
						In reality, she is the compassionate soul of the Dream God, Elfilis, and is scarred from being experimented on. Her unwillingness to discuss
						herself and subsequent failure to keep her past a secret accidentally make her seem suspicious.
					</p>
					<p>
						Likes academics and exploring. Hates hospitals, tight spaces, and being stared at.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Kirby is immediately drawn to her for their opposite personalities, not being used to female attention, and their being
						counterpart gods of sorts. Like him, Elfilin is a small half of a larger and more chaotic god, but she is fully aware of her relation.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					
					</p>
				<h4>Notes</h4>
					<p>
						Elfilin's supposed to look like a chinchilla or a rat, but she ended up like a hare... she and Elfilis are very much like fairies,
						though. Weird hare moth fairies.
