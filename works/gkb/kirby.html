				<h3>Kirby</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Gender: &#9794;</li>
						<li>Height: 148cm (4'10")</li>
						<li>Species: ???</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Dreamland's hero. A bold young man who cares deeply for his friends, but drives them crazy with his theatrics.
						Knows much less than he lets on, to the point that he can't calculate his own strength. This leads to him making as large of messes as the ones he tries to clean up.
					</p>
					<p>
						Likes exploring, cloudspotting, picking fresh fruit, girls, and drinking at the castle bar. Dislikes worms.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kirby's Copy Ability is akin to possession and only requires physical contact to initiate. The affected is rendered unconscious while the ability is in use.
					</p>
				<h4>History</h4>
					<p>
						Crashlanded on Popstar as creepy emotionless child. The only item on his person was the Warp Star and he's possessive of it, believing it
						to be a part of himself. No one knows what he is, and not wanting to deal with the foreboding feeling he gets from him, Dedede makes Rick, Kine, and Coo raise him. They do the best they can for him,
						between their own busy lives, so he's close enough to a model citizen. His reading and writing skills are poor, but he manages to play up things with weird remarks and diction.
					</p>
					<p>
						He's first driven to heroism during the events of Kirby's Dream Land and Kirby's Adventure, but only acts out because the lack of food/sleep personally bother him. He becomes more
						considerate of others during the DM trilogy, especially Gooey and Ribbon, so he actually gains respect from Dreamlanders.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kirby is the result of thousands of years of Ancients conspiring against Dark Matter, the main destructive force in the universe. He's a small, positively-infected
						piece of Nil, the creator of the Dark Matter army, with the larger half later being reborn as Void Termina. As such he can use DM-exclusive powers like Copy Abilities and
						Friend Hearts (by Star Allies), but he's oblivious to the nature of them. He's also stubborn when it comes to Void and defends him post-Star Allies.
