		<h3><u>//2024: The Picross Retrospective</u></h3>
		
		<img src="https://puu.sh/JwAhW.png">
		
		<p>
			<strong>Picross</strong> (noun), from <i>picture</i> and <i>crossword</i>. Also known as nonograms, griddlers, pixel puzzles... with Picross referring
			to any nonogram game developed by Jupiter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shelby should have never made the suggestion. It's been a year and some since I began my Picross journey with my friends Mario and Wario.
			We bled and sweat together, chiseling at stones for days, in search for those fun little pictures that lay beneath the surface; No one knows how
			they got there, but we were going to unearth them. For the sake of <strong>the narrative,</strong> the games will be discussed in the order I played them.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Mario's Super Picross</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty (for a noob): 4/5</li>
				<li>100% completion time: 70 hours</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Normally I would deduct difficulty points for the symmetrical patterns found in many of the puzzles, but even
			when I caught on, I was a noob and my nonogram logic was undeveloped. Readability is also reduced by the graininess of the stones
			you chisel puzzles on; as much as I think it's a fun and creative visual flair, the texture can distract from the working area.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As far as I'm aware, the Picross NP series reuses some puzzles from this title.
			</p>
		
		<h4>Mario's Picross</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty: 1/5</li>
				<li>100% completion time: 7 hours</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This is an easy recommendation for Picross beginners. Punishments are minimal and the sizes/asymmetricality of the puzzles
			make for swift training. It is accessible via emulation, the 3DS Virtual Console, and cheap physical cartridges.
			I bought a Japanese CIB in great condition for $5.</p>
		
		<h4>Picross 2</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty: 3/5</li>
				<li>100% completion time: 50 hours</li>
				<li>Date of completion: 12/27/2022</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">
				Just because they're all 15x15 puzzles doesn't mean it's smooth sailing! Picross 2 offers 278 images in total, but well over <strong>1000 puzzles</strong> must be solved
				for full completion. This includes 40 (160 15x15) missable puzzles—two in each world of Mario and Wario's Picross modes—that are never revealed to the player
				unless they completed the eight (nine) preceding puzzles without quitting, using hints, or running out of time. The Quick Picross levels only need to be cleared once, but similarly
				to Mario's Picross' Time Trial mode, the puzzle you are given to solve is randomly chosen from a pool unique to that level. <sub>You solve for phrases instead of images, so you only see 52 unique characters in
				the English patch.</sub> And despite all of this, the game does not track any of this for you, nor are you compensated... aside from Mario or Wario adding, <strong>"Perfect!!!"</strong> to the end of their
				Congratulations statement, I think?
				It's more of an endurance test than the fast-paced <em>Pokemon Picross,</em> but punishes players subtly... that's probably why I was bored of it near the end. Usually completing a Picross game excites me, so
				take that as you will.
			</p>
			
		<h4>Picross NP Vol.1</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty: 2/5</li>
				<li>100% completion time: 7 hours</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">
				Mario's Super Picross but serialized and with slippery controls that I can't for the life of me understand why they were changed. Every NP title contains 96 puzzles organized into 6 categories, of which the 'Character' category features images from the
				series associated with the title. Upon completion of any section, you receive an official certificate titling you a Picross Rookie, Picross King, Picross Killer, and so on. I think it's an adorable
				way of rewarding and incentivizing the player to complete the other sections.
			</p>
			
		<h4>Picross NP Vol.2 (Yoshi)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty: 2/5</li>
				<li>100% completion time: 10 hours</li>
				<li>Date of completion: 9/13/2023</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">
				More of the same but with Yoshi and Wizard of Oz-themed puzzles. Same strange and slippery controls, same cute rewards and full-color images. Image resolution is impressive even for
				late SNES; they rival N64 2D images, even.
			</p>

	<h4>Picross NP Vol.3 (Kirby)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty: 2/5</li>
				<li>100% completion time: </li>
				<li>Date of completion: //2024</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">

			</p>
			
	<h4>BONUS: PictoQuest: The Cursed Grids</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty: 2/5</li>
				<li>100% completion time: 6 hours </li>
				<li>Date of completion: 1//2024</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">
				Not a <i>Picross</i> game, but a nonogram game nonetheless. I found it on sale around New Year's for $1.99 USD.
