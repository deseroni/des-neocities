			<h4><u>8/16/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					Been to two concerts this week and am heading to a third tonight. I think I have another two coming up, including Everclear, which I'm excited for; they
					put on a fine show, and they'll be at August Hall again. If you don't mind standing, the balcony view there is spectacular. Attracts a younger crowd too.
					I attend a lot of boomer rock shows with my dad so the audiences are usually picky and grumpy.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Had a director's cut watch party for <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLolqgpvKyGEa3UK0IXZV7q5tRuM6uE8i8&si=lKvqADSmG-ut3Q7H">Sonic: The Forgotten Files</a> 
					last night. Plugging because it's super well-researched and his kitbashed editing style makes good use of that research.
				</p>

			<h4><u>8/12/2024</u></h4>	
				<p>
					Took the bus like I said I would earlier this week and checked out the hobby store, game and cards store, and its neighboring market and liquidation store.
					My face dropped when I saw Klonoa Moonlight Museum for $160... fortunately I already emulated it! But the staff was cool, interesting stock, so I'll
					be back around there. Also got some precision brushes from the hobby store for my 3d print keshi and whatever else.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					As much as I love the thrill of the hunt for old games and related items, I don't feel I have much use for them right now. It's a mix of factors: general paranoia about
					wasting money, impracticality as I already emulate many titles, and not having a console I would prefer to play a game on (ADVANCE SP). On the other hand I
					buy new games physically and am fine with cheap Steam/Itch purchases, especially when they benefit indies. Old game purchases are reserved for sentimental value or cases inexpensive enough
					to justify playing on a console. I guess my approach is... if my ownership isn't at the mercy of someone else, I don't mind playing it this or that way.
				</p>

			<h4><u>8/10/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					Trying not to be gloomy, was looking forward to the flea market and shopping with my dad but plans with him almost always fall through.
					Probably gonna take the bus in the morning because being in my room all day is also contributing to my misery. I started listing items
					on eBay a few days ago to keep busy.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					On the bright side, I was accepted into a group exhibition for Feb-Mar 2025! They offer a stipend for materials and want to encourage production
					of new works for the show. Writing a new project proposal and preparing for the eventual artist talk will be fun(?).
				</p>
			<hr class="simplehr">

			<h4><u>8/4/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					It's been a couple of days since I returned from Canada. It was hard on me, and I have scratches below my eyes from wiping them so much. But what an amazing vacation with my favorite person! I wouldn't trade it for the world.
					We'll see when I'm in the mood to write longer entries about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nothing's changed at home, but I've a lot of short and long-term plans lined up and am ready to take them on. Job hunting, getting a driver's license, setting up art commissions (thru VGen or Artistree),
					selling old items, finding the right bookshelf for my room, upcoming artworks and hobby sculptures, painting the front and backyard doors...
				</p>
				<p>
					Streamed painting Little Caesars Shiver for about 3 hours last night. Was great to hear my friends' voices again.
				</p>

			<h4><u>7/28/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					Spent the last two nights collecting stamps to add here since I used to have a long wall of them on my dA page. Found new book and shirt-dress at Value Village,
					had lunch with Tip and her family near the Prim Point lighthouse (incredible view and pasta!), stopped at some beaches. I figured instead of buying more souvenirs, I could make some inexpensive ones for my folks...
					so I gathered sand/shells from two coasts and filled little mason jars with them. They're going to make my backpack noticeably heavier lol.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh, and Cows ice cream. That's the big tourist thing here. Had a scoop of Moo York Cheesecake on a chocolate-dipped waffle cone. Not sure if it's the best ice cream
					I've had but surprisingly cheesy and high quality. The cone was so soft...
				</p>
			<hr class="simplehr">

			<h4><u>7/26/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					Lots of amazing food today, lots of fun!! A delicious breakfast bokit from Datcha, then atlantic salmon bagels, lobster roll, and hamburger grilled by Tip's dad. Failed to kayak on rough waters
					because I'm a n00b, but taking a walk through the warm water exfoliated my legs. Watched the Paris Olympics opening ceremony. Loved the music choices and performances, but what a drag.
				</p>
			<hr class="simplehr">


			<h4><u>7/25/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					Finished <i>ChäoS;HEAd</i> with Tip, and it was so ass. The "chaos head is a masterpiece" vid on YouTube is just one of those summary "essays" so we can say we played the game too.
					I enjoy the original game's UI and high-quality presentation though.
				</p>
				<p>
					Began another PEI painting at the park but packed up early due to the cold breeze. Sbubby for dinner. Read some of <i>Novas Aventuras de Megaman</i> which, for some odd reason, was translated into English...
					not that it answered any questions I had about it when I was 14.
				</p>

			<h4><u>7/24/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					Today's new treat was an Avalanche Beavertail: cheesecake icing, caramel syrup, and SKOR™ on a Beavertail, which is like an elongated funnelcake. Airy and sweet, though the SKOR™
					bits were overpowered by the other condiments. One $8.95 tail easily serves two.
				</p>
				<p>
					Listened to <i>Asakusa Light</i> while doodling Pokemon stuff. I've been sitting on a painting of a defeated Pecha and Tera for two weeks ha.
				</p>
			<hr class="simplehr">
			
			
			<h4><u>7/22/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					Had a Maritime Meat Handpie today. Tip had the Bacon Cheeseburger type. Stuffed to the edges with meat and worth the $10. It's a large Canadian empanada.
				</p>
				<p>
					Been thinking about my AI/human sister characters Abiu and Cai on and off. I haven't drawn them in a few weeks. Trying to figure out how AI works/is responded to in their world
				</p>
			<hr class="simplehr">
		
		
			<h4><u>7/17/2024</u></h4>
				<p>
					With Tip's guidance, I assembled my first GunPla, SD Gundam EX-STANDARD GAT-X105+AQM/E-X01 Aile Strike Gundam. His real name is <i>Mathieu</i>. 
					His red pieces were sprayed with a metallic red and semi-gloss topcoat.
