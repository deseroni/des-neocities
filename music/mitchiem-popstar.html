				<h3>Mitchie M - Virtual Popstar</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Release date: 11/6/2019</li>
						<li>Genre: EDM, electropop, future funk, R&B, symphony
						<li>Featuring: Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin & Len, Megurine Luka, MEIKO, KAITO (vocals), OSTER Project (track 10)</li>
						<li>Runtime: 17 tracks, 1:06:21</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>
						Mitchie M's second studio album, a compilation of his work from 2014 to 2019. The gap between his first and second albums shows how
						meticulous and careful he is. I own the limited edition release, which includes a DVD with all relevant PVs, a keychain illustrated by Haruhiko Mikimoto, and a preorder
						pin of a random Seraphim on the Ring design (I got Miku).
					</p>
					<p>
						While the package is of high quality and a technical marvel as far as VOCALOID tuning goes, its compilation style doesn't allow the
						songs to coalesce meaningfully. The listener bounces from playful story tracks with specific character roles, to upbeat dance music consistent with works featured in
						<i>The Greatest Idol</i> (2013), and unsubtle promotional tracks ("Welcome to Snow Miku!")... some are more successful than others, and the track order doesn't help. 
						I still like the album in spite of its clumsiness.
